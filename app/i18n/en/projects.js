      description: "This page you are currently reading was created mainly because of you. When I started this project, I had already done projects with the same libraries and programming languages, so there was nothing especially hard and tricky in this page to be implemented. What I learned and realized from making this website, was how much I actually had learned about JavaScript, React, and web development from my work projects and free time projects."

      description: "This has been one of my longest free time projects. The project was started because a family summer cottage had too many users to keep track of all chores, repairs and who was there at which time. I have developed the project with multiple technologies and changed the technologies multiple times. The newest version is written in Vue and Node.js. This project is still under development, but I hope that I will finish it some day."

      description: "During my exchange year in Singapore, I wanted to create a website for all travel pictures, so I could share my experience with family and friends. Of course I could have used some existing website, but I had wanted to do some own programming project and this seemed like an good opportunity. I created the website with Angular.js and Node.js. This website was my first totally self made website. After I had returned back home from Singapore, I did some refactoring and gave the website an improved look."

    description: "I developed a home monitoring system to monitor temperature changes inside and outside my apartment. This project consists of multiple parts: two different temperature sensors (one collects only temperature data and the other collects also humidity, pressure and light data), a Raspberry Pi which sends sensor data to cloud, a cloud API, and a cloud front-end service. All of the different parts are written in JavaScript."
