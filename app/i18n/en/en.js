I graduated from Tampere University of Technology almost 1.5 years ago. Since then I have worked as a <span class="highlight">full stack web developer</span>. My main interests are in front-end development and I would like to improve as an UX designer.</p>  <p>By working with customers and <span class="highlight">customer projects</span>, I have become more interested about customer service aspects in a project. I have always had an <span class="highlight">urge to develop something new</span> and I would like to use this urge to create best solutions for each customer.</p>  <p>I have noticed that always what the customer wants is not what the customer actually needs. <span class="highlight">I would like to become an expert to recognize customer needs</span> and find the best solutions to fulfill those needs.</p>',
