  introduction: '<p>Tiina Koskiranta, and I am 26 years old software developer. I graduated from Tampere University of Technology almost three years ago. Since then I have worked as a full stack web developer. My main interests are in front-end development and I would like to improve as an UX designer also.</p>  <p>I have always had an urge to develop something new, and I would like to use this urge to create best solutions for end users and customers. By working with customers and customer projects, I have become more interested about usability and service design. </p>',
