      description: "This page you are currently reading was created mainly because of you. When I started this project, I had already done projects with same libraries and programming languages, so there was nothing especially hard and tricky in this page to be implemented. What I learned and realized from making this website, was how much I actually had learned about JavaScript, React and web development from work projects and own free time projects."

    cottage_page: {
      name: "Cottage home page",
      description: "This has been one of my longest free time projects. The project was started because a family summer cottage had too many users to keep track of all chores, repairs and who was there at which time. I started the project with Ruby and Rails, but soon the interest of learning that language faded. Later on, I started the project again, when I wanted to learn React and JavaScript. This time the backend was written in Node.js. This project has been mainly my React learning exercise and because of this project I have been able to use React and JavaScript more fluently in work projects. When I did the first React version of the web site, I used Alt library to bring flux architecture to the project, but I later refactored the page to use Redux instead. This project is still under development, but I hope that it will be soon finished and I can focus on other projects and perhaps even other technologies."

      description: "During my exchange year in Singapore, I wanted to create a website for all travel pictures, so I could share my experience with family and friends. Of course I could have used some existing website, but I had wanted to do some own programming project and this seemed like an good opportunity. I created the website with Angular.js and Node.js. This website was my first totally self made website. After I had returned back home from Singapore, I did some refactoring and gave the website an improved look."
