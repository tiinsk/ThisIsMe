  introduction: 'I am a software engineer, web developer, and a UX design enthusiast. I am a creative person, and I have always been excited to create something new. My work, with various clients and projects, has taught me the importance of usability and service design in addition to software solutions and architecture. I dream about studying more UX design and improving my UX design skills. In my dream project, I would work closely with UX designers and service designers to make it even more successful. And help UX design and software development processes to progress smoother alongside each other.',
