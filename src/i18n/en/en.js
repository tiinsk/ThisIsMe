  introduction: 'I am a software engineer, web developer, and a UX design enthusiast. I am a creative person, and I have always been excited to create something new. My work, with various clients and projects, has taught me that usability and service design decisions are as significant as software architecture decisions in every project. I am planning to study more UX design and improve my UX design skills.',
