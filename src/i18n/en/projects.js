      description: 'This page you are currently reading was created mainly because of you. When I started this project, I had already done projects with the same libraries and programming languages, so there was nothing especially hard and tricky in this project. What I learned and realized from making this website, was how much I actually had learned about JavaScript, React, and web development from my work projects and free time projects. After completing the first version of this page (in 2017), I have redesigned it couple of times (in 2019 and 2020) and updated some components.'

      description: 'This has been one of my longest free time projects. The project was started because a family summer cottage had too many users to keep track of all chores, repairs and who was there at which time. I have developed the project with multiple technologies and changed the technologies multiple times. The newest version is written in Vue and Node.js. This project is still under development, but I hope that I will finish it some day.'

      description: 'During my exchange year in Singapore, I wanted to create a website for all travel pictures, so I could share my experience with family and friends. Of course I could have used some existing website, but I had wanted to do some own programming project and this seemed like an good opportunity. I created the website with Angular.js and Node.js. This website was my first totally self made website. After I had returned back home from Singapore, I did some refactoring and gave the website an improved look.'

    description: 'I developed a home monitoring system to monitor temperature changes inside and outside my apartment. This project consists of multiple parts: two different temperature sensors (one collects only temperature data and the other collects also humidity, pressure and light data), a Raspberry Pi hub which sends sensor data to cloud, a cloud API, and a cloud front-end service. All of the different parts are written in JavaScript.'

This project is my first design only project, and it has taught me the most about design. This project is still in progress, I have still some fine-tuning to do, but my husband has already started to implement the mobile application by using Flutter and Hasura.'

The Demo version of the site is deployed with Vercel. I used stock images from Unsplash and recipes that I found online, so don't expect to find secret family recipes from this site!"
